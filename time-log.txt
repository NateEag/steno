I'd like to keep tabs on roughly how long it takes me to reach various levels
of competency at steno.

I'm not going to be rigorous - just log it whenever I do some practice, and
make note whenever I hit a point that feels like a milestone of some sort.

Thanksgiving long weekend - 3 hours. Basic familiarity with letters on a QWERTY
steno board.

Train ride to work - 10 mins, three or four times in past week.

2015-12-08 - 20 mins in evening

2015-12-10 - 5 mins in evening

2015-12-11 - 10 mins in morning.

2015-12-11 - 30 mins in evening

2015-12-12 - 30 mins in morning

[long break of having Isaac and also getting a keyboard set up that I can
actually use to do steno with]

2016-07-04 - 30 mins in morning

2016-10-31 - 15 mins in morning

2016-11-01 - 15 mins (on ErgoDox EZ). Successfully creating simple words
without hints, at around 8 wpm (the exercise did not go that well last time I
did it).

2016-11-02 - 15 mins. Got familiar with left- and right-hand keys.

2016-11-04 - 15 mins. Typing small set of basic two-hand one-syllable words ~22
WPM.

2016-11-07 - 10 mins. Worked on same word set again. Speed not really changed.
