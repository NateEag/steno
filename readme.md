I've become interested in the dying art of
[stenography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype),
due to the theoretical possibility of typing faster than people talk.

I may well conclude that learning it is too much work to be worth the benefit.

However, as a programmer and writer, I spend much of my life typing, and
frequently wish I could go faster.

Hence, this repo, in which I investigate the possibility.

This investigation was largely brought on by my discovery of
[Plover](http://plover.stenoknight.com/), which makes stenography practical on
most desktop OSes.

Note that some research and work on "what physical keyboard should I use" is
commingled in this repo, as I'm trying out the ErgoDox EZ as an alternative to
my current default, the TrulyErgonomic (much as I love the TECK's layout, I
have had repeated hardware issues with it, so I have to investigate options).
